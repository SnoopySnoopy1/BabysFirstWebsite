# History For Idiots by An Idiot

Why hello there!
This is HFIBI, an exeedingly awkward acronym for "History for Idiots, By an Idiot". Basically, we go over history in a simple to understand way. 


## World War I
Most people know the general story of WWII, but not many people know its predecessor, the "War to end All Wars" (it wasn't). WWI is many years in the making, and so we go back to 187. 
A dude named  Otto von Bismarck wanted to unify Germany (it was split into a bunch of smaller nation states). So, he started a war against France to reclaim the Alsace-Lorraine. This area will become important later. But since all the German states were excited about getting back this area from France, our friend Otto could leverage the war to unify Germany. Germany stomped France, which made France angry. Now, Germany was surrounded on two sides by France and Russia. Our boy Otto didn't like this, and tried to stop this from occuring. Otto made an alliance with Italy and Austria-Hungary, and made peace with russia as well. 

And then along came Kaiser Wilhelm. Wilhelm thought that these alliances were dumb, so he threw out the peace with Russia. This lead to a soft-alliance between france and russia. Germany was now surrounded, which otto had feared and wilhelm thought was no biggie. Britain and Germany have a naval arms race that was the equivalent of two guys comparing their muscles on a beach. This made the situation more tense, and was one of the reasons WWI started: Militarism. France then agreed to let Italy invade Libya, which is the second main reason for WWI: imperialism. Then, Britain and France sign a non-aggression pact. In 1905, Russia decides to go bully Japan, and promptly gets its butt kicked by Japan. Later on, France and Germany fight a kind of proxy war in Morroco. Britain and Russia have another pact about the countries they want to invade (imperialism). Otto Bismarck's prediction that WWI would start over "some damn [sic] stupid thing in the Balkans" Lo and behold, Austria-Hungary says "hippity hoppity, Bosnia-Herzegovina is now my property", angering the Balkan countries (countries in ther south-east part of Europe, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzgovina, and more). 

Now here is where tensions reach a breaking point. Italy and the Ottoman Empire (modern day-Turkey) have a fight, with Italy winning. The Germans and French fight for control of Morocco. Then the first Balkan war erupts, followed by the Second Balkan War. Tensions are ridiculously high. 

Then someone died. A group called "The Black Hand" in Serbia wanted Austria to give up land to Serbian control to unite ethnic groups. So, in Sarajevo in 1914, a man named Gavrilo Princip tried to kill Franz Ferdinand, the archduke of Austria-Hungary. He threw a bomb, and it missed. Franz Ferdinand was shocked, but unhurt. Then this man went to visit the injured officers in the assasination attempt ON HIM. Instead of high tailing it out of the country, Franz the genius decided to drive around. In an open top car. Then his driver took a wrong turn. Onto a street where, I kid you not, Gavrilo Princip was sitting. Princip then 
shot and killed Ferdinand. 

Austria-Hungary was pretty mad. They sent a bunch of demands to Serbia, who told them to shut it.
