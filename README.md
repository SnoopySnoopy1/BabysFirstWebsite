# History For Idiots by An Idiot

Why hello there!
This is HFIBI, an exeedingly awkward acronym for "History for Idiots, By an Idiot". Basically, we go over history in a simple to understand way. 

##World War I
Most people know the general story of WWII, but not many people know its predecessor, the "War to end All Wars" (it wasn't). WWI is many years in the making, and so we go back to 1870.
